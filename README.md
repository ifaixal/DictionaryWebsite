A fully responsive, theme-switchable dictionary app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6)**. It fetches word definitions, phonetics, and pronunciation audio using the free [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) API.

## 🧰 Built With

- ✅ Semantic **HTML5**
- 🎨 Custom **CSS3** with mobile-first responsive design
- ⚙️ **JavaScript (ES6)** – `fetch()`, async/await, DOM manipulation
- 🌑 **Dark Mode** toggle
- 🔀 **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Search any English word
- 🎧 Play pronunciation audio (if available)
- 🌙 Toggle between Light and Dark mode
- 📱 Fully responsive on all devices
- 🧠 Smart handling of missing or incomplete API data

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using the `fetch()` API and handling async data
- DOM updates and conditional rendering
- Dealing with unpredictable or missing data from an external API
- Implementing a theme switcher with JS and CSS variables
- Clean, responsive layouts with mobile-first design

---

## ⚠️ Known Challenges & Fixes

- API occasionally misses phonetics or audio → Handled with fallback logic.
- Different structure for each word response → Wrote flexible parsing logic.
- Avoided `undefined` and handled broken responses without UI breaking.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

This project was a great learning experience, but I already have ideas for features and improvements I'd like to make:

- [ ] **Font Selector:** Allow users to choose between serif, sans-serif, or monospace fonts.
- [ ] **Save Recent Searches:** Store past search terms in localStorage for quick access.
- [ ] **Favorites Feature:** Let users "star" or bookmark commonly searched words.
- [ ] **Loading Spinner:** Show a spinner or animation while waiting for API responses.
- [ ] **Animated Transitions:** Smooth fade/slide animations for theme toggling and content updates.
- [ ] **Improved Accessibility:** Add ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- [ ] **404 Handling:** Provide a clean and informative error UI for non-existent or misspelled words.
- [ ] **Clickable Synonyms:** Make synonyms and antonyms interactive and searchable.
