# Dictionary Website 🌐📖

A clean and functional dictionary web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed as a learning exercise to practice DOM manipulation, `fetch()` API integration, and dynamic UI rendering based on real-time data from a public dictionary API.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This web app allows users to search for any English word and displays its definitions, phonetics, parts of speech, and pronunciation audio using the [`dictionaryapi.dev`](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) API. It was developed with a strong focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous JavaScript.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Build a responsive and user-friendly dictionary web application that:

- Accepts input from users for a word to search.
- Fetches word definitions and related data from an external API.
- Handles asynchronous calls gracefully.
- Dynamically updates the DOM with the returned data.
- Includes audio playback for pronunciation.
- Provides useful error messages when a word is not found.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- [`dictionaryapi.dev`](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) – Free dictionary API
- **Fetch API** – for making HTTP requests
- **Vercel** – for live deployment

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using `fetch()` to retrieve data from an API
- Parsing and safely accessing nested JSON data
- Creating dynamic elements and injecting them into the DOM
- Handling errors and empty states in the UI
- Audio playback using the `<audio>` element and JavaScript
- Structuring a modular and readable JavaScript project
